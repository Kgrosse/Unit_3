    "Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.\n",

    "We are trying to predict bill pay. This is our outcome. To predict this we will need information on whether or not customers have paid their monthly bill. We can give paid bills a value of 1 and f the bill is unpaid, a value of 0. Now we have four predicotr categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. I would group the categories into essentials (groceries & Utilities) and non-essential (dining out & entertainment). I would then use the KNN method to calculate the euclidean distances to paid bills. "
